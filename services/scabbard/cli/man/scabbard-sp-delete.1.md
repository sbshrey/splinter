NAME
====

**scabbard-sp-delete** â€” Deletes a Sabre smart permission.

SYNOPSIS
========

**scabbard sp delete** \[**FLAGS**\] \[**OPTIONS**\] ORG_ID NAME

DESCRIPTION
===========
This command allows users to delete a Sabre smart permission from the targeted
scabbard service.

FLAGS
=====
`-h`, `--help`
: Prints help information.

`-v`
: Increases verbosity. Specify multiple times for more output.

OPTIONS
=======
`-k`, `--key` FILE
: Indicates the key file to use for signing scabbard transactions. The `FILE`
  can be a relative or absolute file path, or it can be the name of a .priv file
  in the `$HOME/.splinter/keys` directory. The target file must contain a valid
  secp256k1 private key. This option is required.

`--service-id` ID
: Specifies the fully-qualified service ID of the targeted scabbard service,
  using the format `CIRCUIT_ID::SERVICE_ID`. This option is required.

`-U`, `--url` URL
: Specifies the URL for the `splinterd` REST API that is running the targeted
  scabbard service. (default `http://localhost:8080`) This option is required.

`--wait` SECONDS
: If provided, waits the given number of seconds for the batch to commit.
  Displays an error message if the batch does not commit in time.

ARGUMENTS
=========
`ORG_ID`
: Provides the ID of the organization the smart permission applies to.

`NAME`
: Specifies the name of the smart permission to delete.

EXAMPLES
========
The following command removes the `admin` smart permission for the `acme`
organization ID from a scabbard service on circuit `01234-ABCDE` with service ID
`abcd`, running on the node with the REST API endpoint `http://localhost:8088`.
The transaction will be signed with the key located in the file `~/user.priv`.

```
$ scabbard sp delete \
  --url http://localhost:8088 \
  --service-id 01234-ABCDE::abcd \
  --key ~/user.priv \
  acme \
  admin
```

The next command removes the `data_entry` smart permission for the `bubba`
organization ID from the same scabbard service, but specifies a key in the
`$HOME/.splinter/keys` directory by name. It also waits up to 10 seconds for the
smart permission deletion batch to commit.

```
$ scabbard sp delete \
  --url http://localhost:8088 \
  --service-id 01234-ABCDE::abcd \
  --key user \
  --wait 10 \
  bubba \
  data_entry
```
